THE ITERATIONS
==============

In a palpable future, the utopia of the **trip to the past** is an accessible p:ssibility, but bureaucratized, restricted and with strict controls. It has been denigrated to a tourist experience.

A group of old, **romantic hackers** of the twentieth century, sells their skills to buy hours that allow him to resolve **unfinished business** again. Its programming has become undetectable for the new digital systems and they move through the forgotten catacombs of the code.

The adventures of *Stix* and his companions produce **dangerous iterations** that can modify everything, and at the same time, renew the suspicion that time is a huge loop, of unbeatable logic for human intelligence.

In The iterations, *Juanjo Conti* takes us at a good pace for a future that **surprises** us with new melancholy, love stories, old hatreds, latent secrets and unforgettable characters that will remain in the tangle of our memory.
